# Software-Engineering-Assistant

Program able to help Software Engineering to create any type of software

I found myself in the situation of having to make software from scratch for an industrial plant. Usually I modified an already tested base and adapted it to the specific needs of the customer. Starting from scratch I had to read up on software engineering. The documents and books that I have found, in addition to being a little data, give a clue where to start to engineer a software. This is instructive and given the close scan required, I also looked for tools that would automate the process. Perhaps due to the lack of time invested in research, I have not found anything complete or useful for my situation.

Finally I completed my task. And that made me want to create an Assistant that would help anyone who needs to create a piece of software.

This is the path I'm using to get to a complete tool.

Attention, during the study, some parts will be skipped and resumed later.
